Attached you will find an html file for a website for rendering LDraw models, both in a web browser and in VR/MR (let's call them: XR) for Meta Quest 3 headsets. 
The website uses Three.js for rendering the 3D models, both in browser and in XR

We will gradually introduce changes in order to add, remove or improve features, both on the web side and on the XR side.

**Mandatory** ground rules when creating or modifying source code are, in **priority order**:

1. Performant: required for efficient rendering of 3D and VR/MR models
2. Simple: key for adding future features, we need something we can understand easily
3. Idiomatic: expressive acording to JavaScript good style ("taste")
4. Annotated in a specific way for making it easier for you to follow

Before starting modifying the code, do the following:

1. Focus on the JavaScript code for now
2. Analyze and understand the code
3. For every requested modification or feature, draft a plan of actions, organized in stages, items and sub-items

We will proceed as follows: 
- I will ask for a feature or change
- you will make suggestions, 
- we will review them together, 
- and after my approval, you will go ahead to the implementation.
- after finishing, you will provide the result as a downloadable html file
- the file naming for the succesive versions will be like: ldv-v001.html, ldv-v002.html, ...003..., ...004..., etc
